LAUNCHD Port to FreeBSD
 ( this is a work in-progress)

Usage:

LAUNCHD

(1) init replacement
   - configuration file is /etc/launchd.conf
     * launchd commands can be preloaded in this file
     * default contents:
        load /etc/launchd/system
        load /etc/launchd/user
        load /etc/launchd/crone

   - place plist-conformant configuration files in:
       /etc/launchd/system   - for system daemons
       /etc/launchd/user     - for userspace daemons
       /etc/launchd/cron     - for cron-replacement task

     * the subdirectory structure is mainly for the user's convenience
     * launchd loads the configuration files in the order shown above

    sample plist:

    /etc/launchd/system/sshd.plist

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.optim.launchd.sshd</string>
        <key>Program</key>
        <string>/usr/sbin/sshd</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
                <string>/usr/sbin/sshd</string>
                <string>-D</string>
        </array>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>
        <key>Disabled</key>
        <false/>
    </dict>
    </plist>

(2) cron/at/watcherd replacement
   - default location of configuration files is /etc/launchd/crone
   - not as configurable as Vixie cron(cannot specify ranges)
   for sample configuration files, see examples/crone/*

(3) userland launching in place of /etc/rc.d/ scripts
   - default configuration file is $HOME/.launchd.conf
   - to-do


LAUNCHCTL
This is the command line interface to launchd. Probably will be replaced by a lingon clone.
See http://lingon.sourceforge.net.

(1) To control "pid 1" launchd
  (requires root)

   # launchctl
   launchd%       <==== this is the launchd prompt
                   \=== type "help" to see list of available commands


(2) To control non-pid 1 launchd
   * requires that LAUNCHD_SOCKET is set to particular instance of launchd

   e.g.
       $ launchd -d       => daemon mode
         * determine unix socket file
         * the key is the process id

       $ ps -Af | grep launchd
         6567  ??  Is     0:00.00 launchd -d

       $ setenv LAUNCHD_SOCKET /tmp/launchd-6567.XXXX/sock
         * XXXX are random characters

       $launchctl

       launchd%            <== launchd prompt




Enjoy!
